RequestConsumer is more a Socket consumer, and is a barrier for input/output streams
Lots of null checking in request message builder
More cohesion with request deser and http message builder
Dont like these java functions with nondescript names
Response should have body, not content
ACtual error handling

If there's time...

never return nullable object, only optional
use separate validator for authentication/configurable protected routes/passwords
