RequestConsumer is more a Socket consumer, and is a barrier for input/output streams
SocketReader to RequestReader
SocketWriter smells of SRP, it's doing serialization, etc. It should really just be given a string to output, or change its name to responseOutput
Lots of null checking in request message builder
More cohesion with request deser and http message builder
Dont like these java functions with nondescript names
Response should have body, not content
ACtual error handling

If there's time...

never return nullable object, only optional
clean up packaging
use separate validator for authentication/configurable protected routes/passwords
