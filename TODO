RequestConsumer is more a Socket consumer, and is a barrier for input/output streams
SocketReader to RequestReader
SocketWriter smells of SRP, it's doing serialization, etc. It should really just be given a string to output, or change its name to responseOutput

If there's time...

never return nullable object, only optional
clean up packaging
use separate validator for authentication/configurable protected routes/passwords
